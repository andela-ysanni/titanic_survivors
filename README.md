# predicting titanic survivors.

[Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15 April 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died in the sinking, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. .

```datasets folder contains the training sets and test sets```

``` scripts folder contains the two different classifiers(LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier) used in making predictions to these datasets```

```predictions.csv is the predictions made from the datasets in a CSV format with two columns: t_id and probability. The prediction column is the chance of survivor of each passenger on the ship.```

I built a model for the datasets using two different classifiers from scikit-learn. Read the blog post [here](no link yet)
